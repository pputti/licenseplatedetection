# Project 10 - License Plate Detection

### License Plate Detection Notebook

* This project is about License Plate Detection where the car photos with number plates and XML files describing the placement of the number plates using dimensions are given to the model as inputs.
* When an image is submitted to model, it gives the estimated coordinates of the rectangular number plate as an output.
* Then we have cropped the image based on the coordinates provided by model and performed OCR on it to extract the text.

### Data Collection

* In this we downloaded all the data and displayed all the car images with number plates and all the XML files and then preprocessed the data.
